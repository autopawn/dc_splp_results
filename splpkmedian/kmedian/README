This package contains k-median-type problems for uncapacitated facility 
location. The files in the package are as follows:

*-10		Problems for facility location, 
		for * = 500, 1000, 1500, 2000, 2500, 3000

*-#.bub		Best solutions found,
		for * as above and # = 10, 100, 1000

changefile.c	Program to manipulate opening costs
README	   	This file

The problem file structure is as follows:
On the first line there is the filename, on the second line the number of 
facilities, cities and a 0. Then on each line there is the data for one 
of the facilities:
[number] [opening cost] [cost of connect. city 1] ... [cost of connect. city m]

The solution files consist of one line. The ith number is the facility, 
to which city i is connected. Facility numbering starts with 0. The 
final number in the file is the cost of the solution.

Changefile needs 3 parameters: [DENOM] [SOURCEFILE] [TARGETFILE]
It takes the data from the source file, devides all opening costs by the 
specified value DENOM (rounds the results to integer) and writes a new problem 
in the target file with new opening and equal connection costs.
